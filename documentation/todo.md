# WHILE DEVELOPMENT:

### Front-End

- fix company logos when resized to small

- add favicon to index.html (currently not working, maybe use : https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-favicon )
- fix TEAM/ LEGAL/ CONTACT pages html/css
- revise media queries (esp bootcamp sections)
- when you open review pages header is slightly covering up body fix it (its when you scroll down on main page before you enter a review page) (scrollTop ? )
- move to redux
- figure out chart data from api

### Back end

- how to debug inside route.get or route.post from vscode ?
